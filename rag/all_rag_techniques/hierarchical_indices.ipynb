    "# 分层索引在文档检索中的应用\n",
    "\n",
    "## 概览\n",
    "\n",
    "这段代码实现了一个分层索引系统用于文档检索，采用两个级别的编码：文档级别的摘要和详细的片段。这种方法旨在通过首先通过摘要识别相关文档部分，然后深入到这些部分的具体细节中，来提高信息检索的效率和相关性。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 动机\n",
    "\n",
    "传统的平面索引方法可能在处理大型文档或语料库时遇到困难，可能会错过上下文或返回不相关信息。分层索引通过创建一个两级搜索系统来解决这个问题，允许更有效和上下文感知的检索。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 关键组成部分\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PDF处理和文本分块\n",
    "2. 使用OpenAI的GPT-4异步文档摘要\n",
    "3. 使用FAISS和OpenAI嵌入创建摘要和详细片段的向量存储\n",
    "4. 自定义的分层检索函数\n",
    "\n",
    "## 方法细节\n",
    "\n",
    "### 文档预处理和编码\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 加载PDF并将其分割成文档（可能按页面）。\n",
    "2. 每个文档都使用GPT-4异步摘要。\n",
    "3. 原始文档也被分割成更小的详细片段。\n",
    "4. 创建两个单独的向量存储：\n",
    "   - 一个用于文档级别的摘要\n",
    "   - 一个用于详细片段\n",
    "\n",
    "### 异步处理和速率限制\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 代码使用异步编程（asyncio）来提高效率。\n",
    "2. 实现批处理和指数退避来处理API速率限制。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 分层检索\n",
    "\n",
    "`retrieve_hierarchical`函数实现了两级搜索：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 它首先搜索摘要向量存储以识别相关文档部分。\n",
    "2. 对于每个相关摘要，然后搜索详细片段向量存储，按相应的页码过滤。\n",
    "3. 这种方法确保只从最相关的文档部分检索详细信息。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 这种方法的好处\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 提高检索效率：通过首先搜索摘要，系统可以快速识别相关文档部分，而无需处理所有详细片段。\n",
    "2. 更好的上下文保留：分层方法有助于保持检索信息的更广泛上下文。\n",
    "3. 可扩展性：这种方法特别适合大型文档或语料库，平面搜索可能效率低下或错过重要上下文。\n",
    "4. 灵活性：系统允许调整检索的摘要和片段数量，可以为不同的用例进行微调。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 实现细节\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 异步编程：使用Python的asyncio进行高效的I/O操作和API调用。\n",
    "2. 速率限制处理：实现批处理和指数退避，有效管理API速率限制。\n",
    "3. 持久存储：将生成的向量存储本地保存，以避免不必要的重新计算。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 结论\n",
    "\n",
    "分层索引代表了一种复杂的文档检索方法，特别适合用于大型或复杂的文档集。通过利用高层次的摘要和详细的片段，它在广泛的上下文理解和特定信息检索之间提供了平衡。这种方法在需要高效和上下文感知的信息检索的各个领域都有潜在的应用，例如法律文件分析、学术研究或大规模内容管理系统。\n"
