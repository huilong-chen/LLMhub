Query: [{query}]
You are obliged to choose only from the following list.
Scoring Criteria:
1 Point - Moderately Difficult: Involves understanding specific programming concepts or libraries, and may include medium complexity algorithms or data structures like basic sorting algorithms or tree structures.
2 Points - Challenging: Requires handling more complex logic or algorithms such as advanced sorting algorithms, recursive logic, or intermediate data structures like hash tables and heaps.
3 Points - Highly Challenging: Demands deeper knowledge in algorithms and data structures, potentially including graph algorithms, dynamic programming, or complex string manipulation techniques.
4 Points - Advanced: Focuses on proficiency in programming and algorithm design, dealing with complex system architecture issues, performance optimization, or solving advanced algorithmic challenges like NP-hard problems.
5 Points - Expert Level: The highest difficulty level, requiring innovative problem-solving approaches or unique algorithm design, possibly involving interdisciplinary knowledge or the application of cutting-edge technologies.
