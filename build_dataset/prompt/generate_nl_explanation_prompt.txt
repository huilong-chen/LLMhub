Here is a list containing a series of dialogues between a user and a programmer assistant.
Following the previous dialogues, the user posed a latest problem.
The assistant has now crafted the correct code based on the previous dialogues and the latest problem.
Assuming you are this programmer assistant, please add some text before the code.
The purpose of this text is to respond to the latest problem and to introduce the code that follows.
This text may include: language used in the code, algorithm used in the code, step-by-step implementation overview, and other relevant content.
You may use phrases like "The following code", "My code", "My solution", to refer to the @@Code.
Your response should ONLY contain the text that you add before the code.
Your only task is to write the text, never modify the code or remind me something.
Never restate the previous dialogues and the problem.
